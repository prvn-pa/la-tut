\large
\begin{itemize}
\item Recently magnetization switching in nanopillar devices has been a continuously growing topic, because of its potential applications in ultra-high density recording media, magnetic memory devices, magnetic sensors and read / write heads etc. 
\item The speed of switching of magnetization in magnetic trilayers is an issue of increasing importance for applications. Magnetocrystalline anisotropy, shape anisotropy and surface anisotropy play a vital role in reducing the switching time.
\item There is an important magnetostatic coupling between the ferromagnetic layers in the nanopillar  due to surface roughness  referred as \textbf{Neel Coupling} or \textbf{Orange Peel Coupling} which is expected to contribute to the reduction of the switching time.
\item In this work, we investigate the impact of orange peel coupling on magnetization switching time in  Co/ Cu/ NiFe (Py) nanopillar device.

\blocknode{Conclusions}{
\large
\begin{itemize}
\item The spin current induced magnetization switching dynamics in Co/Cu/NiFe nanopillar with orange peel coupling is studied by solving the governing Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert- Slonczewski equation numerically.
\item The switching time of the nanopillar device reduces from 67 ps to 48 ps  when there exists the orange peel coupling between the ferromagnetic layers.
\item The switching time decreases, when the thickness of the spacer layer and also the free layer reduces.
\item Thus, We can achieve fast switching by making the free layer and spacer layer in the nanopillar device with  minimal thicknesses.
