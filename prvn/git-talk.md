## Git ##

* Git is a version control system (VCS) 
* It helps you keep a record of changes you make to files in your project. 
* It keeps track of the changes and enables you to create checkpoints for each change. 
* These checkpoints can also be seen as versions of your project. 
* For example, you create a web form and add a commit, and you decide to edit that form tomorrow, the new change can be considered a new version of your original work.

## Here's an example! ##

## Github ##

* Github is a website for hosting your repositories. 
* A repository is simply a place where you can store your project files and folders. 
* A new repository is created for each project on Git. On your computer, a repository is represented by a folder. 
* After working on your project or a part of it on Git (offline), you can push it to your repository on Github.

## Here's an another example! ##

## Git Installation ##

In Ubuntu, install git by the command `sudo apt install git`

In windows, download the installer from [here](https://gitforwindows.org/). Run it with administrator privileges. Accept the default values and choose Windows Command Prompt for accessing git.

Verify the installation by `git --version`

Once you installed `git` define global username and mail ID from terminal or command prompt.
```
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"   
$ git config --global user.email "your@mail.id"
```
